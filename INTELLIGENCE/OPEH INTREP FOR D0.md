# OPERATION EASTERN-HAMMER - INTREP FOR D+0
v1, UPDATED 04-APR-2022

## ENEMY GROUND FORCE SITUATION

For the past several days, the situation is that of a low-intensity warfare:

* Enemy is performing harassment fires by artillery – Both rocket and barrel – into Northern Israel.<br>
* These indirect fires are sporadic and are mostly meant to disrupt civilian day-to-day life in the Galilee and Golan regions as well as disrupt allied forces’ preparations of military assets in the region (Movement of units, intel-gathering efforts etc’)


### SYRIAN FRONT

1) No ground maneuvers are being observed across the border.<br>

2) INTEL estimates that the maneuvering elements of the 3rd Corps are not yet ready to advance towards the border and are still at their staging phase (See [SYRIAN GROUND FORCE COMBAT TACTICS](https://cloud.132virtualwing.org/s/nMrojaiiqQBafN3) )<br>

3) The Syrian 3rd Corps is deployed along the ISR-SYR border. As of now all enemy forces are sighted East of UNDOF line “BRAVO” (The Eastern border of the 1974 demilitarized zone or “UNDOF ZONE”)<br>

4) The 3rd corps consists primarily of 3 divisions:<br>
4a) 30th armored division is deployed along the Northern part of the border from just South of Mt. Hermon.<br>
4b) 31st mechanized division is deployed further South.<br>
4c) 32nd motorized division is holding a rear position.<br>

5) Both 30th armored and 31st mechanized divisions are presumed to be staging for an offensive into the Israeli-held Golan Heights. The 32nd motorized division is presumed to be standing ready to either support either the 31st or 32nd or to exploit success of either of the divisions.<br>

6) The Syrian 1st corps and 5th corps are deployed further North-East around the capital city of DAMASCUS. The 1st is believed to be a strategic reserve while the 5th is presumed to be guarding DAMASCUS and the Syrian high leadership.<br>

7) Of the 1st corps, the 10th armored division is identified to be staging West of DAMASCUS. Its location is close to several key roads leading from Syria into Lebanon. It is therefore believed that this division may be used for maneuvering West into Lebanon with intent to pursue one of two possible objectives:<br>
7a) Deploy in a defensive stance to defend the BEIRUT-DAMASCUS highway which is a vital supply-line (And might be threatened by an Israeli offensive into Lebanon)<br>
7b) Advance South to threaten or to attack the LEB-ISR border into the Galilee area, threatening KIRYAT-SHMONA and other Israeli population centers in the area.<br>

8) Diplomatic efforts are still underway to try to prevent further escalation of the situation in the Middle East.<br>

9) With a diplomatic solution still a possibility (Although remote), the allied forces in the region are being held at a WEAPONS HOLD and are only authorized to react to enemy fires into Israel or as self defense. Additional ROE instructions will follow.

#### SYRIAN AIR DEFENCES
The Syrian 3rd Corps is supported by (x3) battalions of SA-11 SAMs. One of the battalions is an organic element of the 3rd Corps while the two others are believed to be a reinforcement from the Syrian strategic reserve. Estimated locations of the SA11 battalions are provided in the CF file linked below. However it should be noted that those are approximated locations and that the batteries may have moved to alternate positions already.

From the location of the SA11s it apears that the Syrian HQ is trying to primarily use them to provide cover for the 3rd Corps staging areas. We anticipate that shortly or during the 3rd Corps ground maneuver commences, the SA11 batteries will advance forward closer to the border to provide cover to the advancing forces and deny allied air forces of air superiority over the Golan Heights.

#### IRANIAN FORCES IN THE SYRIAN FRONT
As of now we do not recognize involvement of Iranian forces close to the Israeli border. We estimate that small Iranian forces are currently holding defensive position to defend Iranian interests on Syrian soil.

## LEBANESSE FRONT / HEZBOLLAH
1. Very little intelligence available of HZB activities.

2. HZB has been involved in sporadic indirect fires into Israel, mostly GRAD and mortar rockets targeting IDF bases and facilities

3. Indications are that HZB is mobilizing its reserve and is reinforcing its short and medium-range artillery assets along the ISR-LEB border. The reason is likely to have a sustained ability to generate fires for the time to come should the situation escalate.

4. There are currently no data regarding any plans of using RADUAN commando companies to launch ground offensives into Israel at this time.

5. Our sources believe that for the near future HZB will opt to continue harassing Israeli border area with indirect artillery fire rather than launching its own ground maneuvers. This, however, could change as the crisis evolves.

## ENEMY AIR FORCE SITUATION
### SYRIAN AIR ASSETS

Syrian air force is presumably intending to allocate two air divisions to support the operation against Israel.
The likely COA (Course Of Action) is that Syrian senior command will opt to rely on its SAM coverage in order to deny air superiority from allied air forces while keeping Syrian air assets on alert and activated only in case the SAM system is degraded.

#### The 51st Air Defense Division

The 51st Air Defense Division has its regiments deployed in the airbases around DAMASCUS. Those regiments operate mostly MIG-23s , MIG-25s and MIG29s
Most regiments of the 51st are currently at LOW READINESS and still undergo maintenance in preparation for launching the offensive.
We estimate QRA flights at +5 at MARJ-RUHAYYIL and AL-DUMAYR airbases.

#### The 52nd Bomber Division

The 52nd Bomber Division is deployed primarily in the airbases North-East of DAMASCUS. The 52nd's regiments operate SU-24s, SU-17s and SU-25s
Most regiments of the 52nd are currently at LOW READINESS and still undergo maintenance in preparation for launching the offensive.
