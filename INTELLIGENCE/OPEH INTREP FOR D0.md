# OPERATION EASTERN-HAMMER - INTREP FOR D+0

## SYRIAN GROUND FORCE SITUATION

The Syrian 7th corps is deployed along the ISR-SYR border still East of UNDOF line "BRAVO" (The Eastern border of the 1974 demilitarized zone)

7th corps consists primarily of 3 divisions:

71st armored division is deployed along the Northern part of the border from just South of Mt.Hermon.

72nd mechanized division is deployed further South.

73rd motorized division is holding a rear position.

Both 71st and 72nd divisions are presumed to be staging for an offensive into the Israeli-held Golan Heights. The 73rd motorized division is presumed to be standing ready to either support either the 71st or 72nd or to exploit success of either of the divisions.

The Syrian 8th and 9th corps are deployed further North-East around DAMASCUS. The 8th is believed to be a strategic reserve while the 9th is presumed to be guarding DAMASCUS and the Syrian high leadership.

Of the 8th corps, the 81st armored division is identified to be staging West of DAMASCUS. Its location is close to several roads leading from Syria into Lebanon. It is therefore believed that this division may be used for maneuvering West into Lebanon for two possible objectives:

1)  Deploy in a defensive stance to defend the BEIRUT-DAMASCUS highway which is a vital supply-line (And might be threatened by an Israeli offensive into Lebanon) <br>
2)  Advance South to threaten or to attack the LEB-ISR border into the Galilee area, threatening KIRYAT-SHMONA and other Israeli population centers in the area.

## HEZBOLLAH - SITUATION
Very little intelligence available of HZB activities. Indications are that HZB is mobilizing its reserve and is reinforcing its short and medium-range artillery assets along the ISR-LEB border. There are currently no data regarding any plans of using Raduan commando companies to launch ground offensives into Israel at this time.

## IRANIAN ARMY SITUATION

It is estimated that iranian ground elements may be present in Syria at D+0 but those elements are expected to be at minimal stength and are likely be engaged in defensive duties defending Iranian assets in Syria.
