Briefing material for 132nd Virtual Wing- Operation Eastern Hammer campaign

**SITUATION
**

Starting around 2014, a long and bloody civil war errupted in Syria.
Forces loyal to the Syrian president fought against a variaty of militia organizations throughout Syria. Some of those organizations were fighting for the Syrian people, others were merely taking advantage of the chaos and lack of government control to gain their own territorial advantages.
Of the militia groups active in Syria at the time were groups of Iranian-funded merceneries that formed their camps in Southern Syria close to the Syrian-Israeli border. Those groups were Iranian proxy groups intended to shape the conditions for a constant Iranian presence in front of the Israeli border with the intent of being used as an additional front against Israel for deterrance as well as staging combat operations during any future Iranian-Israeli conflict.
With the gradual decline in the civil war and the Syrian military slowly recovering its strength, the Iranian proxies were replaced by a sizeable Iranian expedetionary force composed of armed and mechanized units as well as intelligence gathering assets operating from bases and outposts close to the border and Iranian air-force elements staging in airbases throughout Syria.
In addition to the increased presence in Syria, Iranian-funded Hezbollah guerrilla military has bolstered its forces in the Southern-Lebanon region as well as setting up its own forward bases along the Israeli-Syrian border with the goal of increasing its flexibility in future conflicts against Israel.
With the heavy presence of Hezbollah in Southern-Lebanon, the national Lebanese military essentially withrew from Southern-Lebanon, being unable to challenge the strength of Hezbollah.

This buildup of forces was continuing gradually with minor, local skirmishes with IDF (Israeli Defense Force / Israeli military) trying to slow down the buildup of forces and the transfer of advance weapons from Iran to Syria and Lebanon. 

Parallel to the above, Russia has also been using the situation in Syria to its advantage by dispatching air and ground forces and securing the major sea port Tartus as a primary naval base in the Mediterranean.
With the increase in tension and many forces facing each other, a full scale war was only a matter of time.

**THE 2022 ESCALATION
**

On January 10th, a convoy carrying advanced SAM systems was attacked by the Israeli Air Force when traveling from Syria to Lebanon. As the convoy was travaling in a Lebanese village when being hit, several civilian casualties were reported.
Hezbollah, constantly declaring the safety of Lebanese population as his prime concern, retaliated by launched sevedral SMERCH and GRAD rockets at Israeli population centers from its bases in Lebanon and Syria.
While most of the rockets were harmlessly intercepted by Iron-Dome air-defense system, there were numerous casualties resulting.
The IDF increased its readiness along the Northern border as the Israeli Air Force launched a major offensive against the launch sites used by Hezbollah in Syria and Southern Lebanon.
Iran and Syria quickly issued a joint statement saying that "the recent aggression by Israel will not go unnoticed" and began mobilizing forces in bases in Southern Syria.
Russia announced it will not tolerate threats posed on its assets in Syria and declared a major reinforcement of its forces in Syria.

At Israel's urgent request, the UN has authorized the immediate dispatch of CJTF-66 with the hope of deterring its adversaries or support Israel if a conflict should erupt. All forces were put on alert for executing OPERATION EASTERN-HAMMER
