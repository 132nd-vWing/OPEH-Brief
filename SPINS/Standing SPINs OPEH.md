# 3 Command, Control and Communications (C3)
During operations flightleads will be responsible for their flights.

During operations package commanders will be in charge of a package of flights

On AR missions with multiple flights, AR flights will normally be directed by a SCAR flight. If not SCAR flight is present, best suited flight should assume the role of SCAR to coordination the operation ensure safe and effective operations.

All flights shall follow ATC and AWACS Controller instructions. All flights are to monitor ATC frequencies when within an airfields airspace control zone.

All flights shall remain on a C2 frequency at all times, unless approved by a C2 agency to do something else.

### 3.1.1 Flightplan
All flights are to file a flightplan prior to the mission. Flightplan should contain airbase you are taking off from, where you are flying, what mission /task you are conducting, and airbase you are landing at. The flightplan can also include the flights loadout. Flightplans are used to increase the situational awareness of AWACS controllers during the flight.

### 3.1.2 SADL information
Group ID’s is assigned per SQN. 617th Uses 31-35. Other squadrons use 36-39. Flights will use their flight number for Own ID's. For example: TUSK 2-1 and 2-2 will use a OID of 21 and 22.

### 3.1.3 Authentication
Authentication will be conducted with AET-100. Backup is RAMROD

### 3.1.4 RAMROD
Even days (2,4,6,8): LUMBERJACK </br>

### 3.1.7 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe)
Flights will be assigned IFF codes in the ATO, available on the 132nd website.

### 3.1.8 Laser Codes
Flights will be assigned Lasercodes codes in the ATO, available on the 132nd website.

### 3.1.9 TACAN
Flights will be assigned TACAN codes in the ATO, available on the 132nd website.

## 3.2 Command and Control Frequencies

### 3.2.1 AWACS frequencies
These frequencies are used by AWACS to control aircraft.

Check-in: 231.500 (GREEN 7)

In Flight Report Net: 228.0 (ORANGE 10)

Air Request Net: 21.00 FM

CSAR Net: 233.0 (PINK 1)

VHF Backup: 122.250 (GRAY 10)

Ground Alert frequency (Scramble frequency): 248.75 (GREEN 6)

### 3.2.2 Tactical frequencies

### 3.2.3 JTAC frequencies and callsigns

### 3.2.4 AWACS check-in Check-in with AWACS are to be done at the following locations:
TBD

## 3.3 Codewords Action/event Codeword
TBD

## 3.4 Reporting

### 3.4.1 In-Flight Report (INFLTREP)
TBD

### 3.4.2 After Action Report (AAR)
After completion of mission, all pilots and controllers are to file an after action report. The after action report contains the following important information, and is filled out on the 132nd website:

- Event sequence: What was done in the mission. Where was it flown.

- Lessons Learned: What experiences was done in the mission. What worked, what did not work. Suggestions of tactics that may work, or other ideas on how to solve the mission or handling situations.

- Battle Damage Assessment (BDA): If there are delivered any ordnance (both A-A and A-G) fill out the BDA for the engagement. If a pilot do not have a confirmed BDA it should be noted as not confirmed, but a best assessment should be provided.

- Intel: Any information or observation that can be of value for intelligence gathering.

- Attachements: Any pictures (TGP / HUD / out of cockpit / LotATC radar tracks) are to be posted in the #bda-reports channel on the 132nd Discord server or as a link in the AAR.


#### 3.4.2.1 Reporting instructions
- For BDA and Intel: locations are to be provided in accordance with section 2.2.

- The Virtual Intelligence Service (VIS) analysts do not have details of individual pilots/flights plans, or their planned navpoints, so it is important that all locations are in a format that can be used directly in CombatFlite for processing. All necessary details/information need to be within the AAR, so the analysts can understand the full picture.

- Pictures is often good supplements to the written report, and it is encouraged for pilots that encounter situations to also provide documentation in the form of pictures

- The individual reporting from each pilot is very important in this operation, as VIS rely in this information to understand what is happening, and to prepare for future mission and priorities.

# 5 Offensive operations

## 5.1 Acceptable Level of Risk (ALR)
TBD

### 5.1.1 Standard Acceptable Level of Risk
The standard Acceptable Level of Risk (ALR) in OPERATION ACTIVE RESOLVE is MEDIUM. Deviations will be stated in amplifications in flight tasking in the ATO, or on Joint Prioritized Target List (JPTL) for AI operations.

## 5.2 Target priority grade

###5.2.1 Target priority A

The target is essential for mission success in support of current objectives (or the target is a designated High Value Target, High Payoff Target, or TST).
Target with priority A is crucial to the overall success of the operation.
Target with priority A will have immediate and compelling effects.
Its timeliness as an urgent target for targets with priority A may not exist in the future.
If not targeted, negative consequences may seriously jeopardize future CJTF operations.

### 5.2.2 Target priority B
Targets have substantial, but not immediate impact on the battle.
The cascading effects this target provides may not be realized in the future.
If not targeted on this ATO, a significant level of effort may be required later.
If not targeted , negative consequence may significantly hamper CJTF operations.

### 5.2.3 Target priority C
Target with priority C will contribute to the battle, but it is not critical to mission success.
Targeting a target with priority C will further the success of the operation.
Targets with priority C will eventually require targeting due to Combined Joint Force Commanders (CJTF) future plans.
If not targeted on this ATO, negative consequences will probably not impede ongoing operations.

### 5.2.4 Target priority D
Target of opportunity if:
A: Other targets not suitable for this ATO.
B: As a backup target
Targets with priority D will have minor contributions to the operation.
Targets with priority D may be required for targeting, but is not time critical.
Targets with priority D will not have a negative impact if not targeted.

## 5.3 Effects
The following effects may be tasked on the ATO:

### 5.3.1 Destroy
1) To damage the condition of the target so that it cannot function as intended nor to be restored to a usable condition.
2) Damage done to the function is permanent, and all aspects of the function have been affected.
3) A function's operation is permanently impaired, and the damage extends to all facets of the function's operation.

### 5.3.2 Degrade
1) Damage done to the function is permanent, but only portions of the function were affected, that is, the function is still operational, but not fully
2) A functions operation is permanently impaired, but the damage does not extend to all facets of the functions operation.

## 5.6 Time Sensitive Targeting (TST) 
TST are of critical importance for the overall execution of the campaign. If any TST target is located during execution of a mission, this will take precedence over any other tasking, and resources should be used to neutralize this target.
TST matrix with valid TST targets , desired effect and accepted risk level is published daily together with the Joint Prioritized Target List (JPTL) by JFACC.

# 6 Tanker information
Tankers information can be retrieved in the CombatFlite (CF) file for each mission.

In general:

KC-135 are used for boom operations (F-16 / A-10)
KC-135 MPRS are used for drogue operations (F/A-18 / F-14)

## 6.1 Tanker tracks.

Tanker tracks will be named ARXXX.
AR6XX (Callsign TEXACO) for boom operations lower speed (speed 220kts FL115).
AR7XX (Callsign ARCO) for boom operations higher speed (speed Mach 0.6)
AR8XX (Callsign SHELL) for drogue operations (speed Mach 0.6)

Altimeter setting:

Unless otherwise directed an altimeter setting of standard pressure setting (29.92) is to be used for AAR operations.

## 6.2 Vertical separation.
Receivers are to join from below and are to maintain a minimum of 1000ft vertical separation (unless otherwise directed by the controlling agency) , until visual contact have been made.

## 6.3 Clearance.
Receivers must receive clearance from the controlling agency (AWACS) before contacting the tanker.

## 6.4 Joining procedures.
The left side of the tanker is to be used for joining aircraft. The first reciver of a formation may join directly astern the boom, when the reciver has visually confirmed that no refueling is in progress.

# 7 Airspace information

## 7.1 International airspace
12 nm outside Lebanon, Israel, Turkey is defined as international airspace.

## 7.2 Airspace Control Measures.
Control/Initial Points are to be used for command and control of the airspace. These points can be used in flightplans. Minimum Risk Routes will be routes between Control/Initial Points.
See Appendix Afor a list and map of Control/Initial Points

### 7.2.1 Control Points (CP).
Control Points are points to be used to establish communications (check-in) with AWACS/FAC(A)/SCAR/JTAC’s.

### 7.2.2 Initial Points (IP).
Initial points are primarily designed to facilitate initial points for attack runs in CAS operations. A secondary use is that they can be used as control points

### 7.2.3 Airspace Control Point(ACP).
Airspace Control Point are primarily designed to be routingpoints for airtraffic.

### 7.2.4 Killbox.
Killbox is a three-dimensional target area.It is a coordination measure enabling air assets to engage surface targets without needing further coordination with commanders and without terminal attack control. A killbox can be under the control of any flight.The space is defined by an area reference system.. A Killbox can be either active or closed. Killboxes are assigned in ATO and are pre-planned.

#### 7.2.4.1 Active Killbox.
This is a killbox currently in use by someone.

#### 7.2.4.2 Closed Killbox
This is a killbox currently not in use by anyone, and impose no restrictions on air operations. This is the default value for killboxes.

#### 7.2.4.3 Restricted Operating Zone (ROZ).
ROZ are a temporarily airspace zone established for a specific mission. ROZ can be used to facilitate SCAR, CAS or any other mission. As with Killbox, a ROZ have a owner that control that ROZ, and to enter the ROZ one need to establish communications with the current controlling agency (FAC(A), SCAR, Flight, JTAC, AWACS). A ROZ can be established temporarily during mission execution through AWACS.

#### 7.2.4.4 Minimum Risk Routes
Minimum Risk Route is a route that will keep air traffic fairly safe from threats and are used to route traffic within friendly airspace.

#### 7.2.4.5 Altimeter settings.
QNH is the altimeter pressure setting to be used by all aircrafts.

#### 7.2.4.6 Standard Pressure Settings (SPS).
For operations in 132nd Virtual Wing hosted events we use standard pressure setting at altitudes above 7000ft AMSL. When climbing above 7500ft, switch to standard pressure setting (29.92). Altitudes will be given as flight levels(FL)when operating on SPS. When descending below FL085, switch back to local QNH.

#### 7.2.4.7 Force QNH.
Any C2 agency (including AWACS, JTAC, FAC(A) and SCAR) can establish a force QNH within his area of responsibility. This in-order to avoid unnecessary QNH changes. When operating on force QNH, the C2 agency need to make sure all assets are briefed on the QNH in use prior to entering the area.
